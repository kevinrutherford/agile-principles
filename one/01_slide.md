Principles

!SLIDE
# principle #1

Our highest priority is  
to satisfy the customer  
through early and continuous delivery  
of valuable software.

!SLIDE
# principle #2

We welcome changing requirements,  
even late in development.  
Agile processes harness change  
for the customer's competitive advantage.

!SLIDE
# principle #3

Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

!SLIDE
# principle #4

Business people and developers must work 
together daily  
throughout the project.

!SLIDE
# principle #5

Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

!SLIDE
# principle #6

The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.

!SLIDE
# principle #7

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

!SLIDE
# principle #8

Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

!SLIDE
# principle #9

Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

!SLIDE
# principle #10

Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done -- is essential.

!SLIDE
# principle #11

The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.

!SLIDE
# principle #12

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.
